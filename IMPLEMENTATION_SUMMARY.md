# Implementation Summary: Smart Notification System

## What We've Implemented

### 1. **Updated Terraform Infrastructure**
- Added DynamoDB table `matcha-notification-state` for tracking notification state
- Changed cron schedule from 3 times daily to **every minute during 1-3 PM JST** (`cron(* 4-6 * * ? *)`)
- Added DynamoDB table name as environment variable

### 2. **Enhanced Go Application**
- Added AWS SDK for DynamoDB integration
- Created `NotificationState` struct to track daily notifications
- Added methods for state management:
  - `GetNotificationState()` - Check if already notified today
  - `UpdateNotificationState()` - Mark as notified to prevent duplicates
  - `ClearNotificationState()` - Reset when products go out of stock

### 3. **Smart Notification Logic**
**The new flow:**
```
1. Scrape products every minute (1-3 PM JST)
2. If products in stock:
   - Check if already notified today
   - If NOT notified: Send telegram message + mark as notified
   - If already notified: Do nothing (no spam!)
3. If products out of stock:
   - Clear notification state (ready for next restock)
```

## Key Benefits

✅ **No notification spam** - Only one message per restock event  
✅ **High frequency monitoring** - Every minute during peak hours  
✅ **Automatic reset** - Ready for next restock when products sell out  
✅ **Reliable state tracking** - Uses DynamoDB for persistence  

## Next Steps

1. **Update dependencies**: Run `go mod tidy` to download AWS SDK
2. **Update IAM role**: Your Lambda role needs DynamoDB permissions
3. **Deploy**: Run `terraform apply` to deploy changes

## Cost Impact
- DynamoDB: ~$0.01/month (minimal usage)
- Lambda invocations: ~$1-2/month (120 runs per day)
- Total additional cost: **~$2-3/month**

## Testing
The Lambda function now returns descriptive messages:
- "Notification sent" - First notification of restock
- "Already notified today" - Subsequent checks while in stock
- "State cleared - ready for next restock" - When products sell out
- "No stock, no notification needed" - Normal out-of-stock state
